# Capstone Project for the IBM Data Science Specialization

#### This Folder contains all Jupyter Notebooks of the final assignment for the IBM Data Science Specialization on Coursera. The Specialization covers the complete cycle of data science projects, starting from defining buisness problems, over data collection, manipulation, interactive visualizaton and analysis (including various machine learning techniques such as KNN, logistic regression, decision trees and SVM) up to writing a report. The course hereby relies heavily on Python and SQL, including libraries such as pandas, numpy, dash, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, folium and several others.
